## General Information
This repository contains the code to print `Hello, World!` to standard output in many languages. All code was created by me, Isaac Joffe, in January of 2022.

## Description
The aim of the project is to create basic "Hello, World!" test programs in as many languages as possible. All the programs output the string literal `Hello, World!` to standard output.

## Background
The "Hello, World!" program is a common test program used to ensure proper functionality of a hardware and software system. It is widely used to outline the fundamentals of a programming language, and has been universally used since its inception in the 1970s. More information about the program's origin and use can be found at the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program.

## Technologies
The code contained is written across many languages, currently including Python 3.8.10, C++, and MATLAB r2020a. I created all the code using my personal virtual machine, which runs the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system, through the Sublime Text text editor and the Linux terminal window for the Python and C++ versions, and using the MATLAB software package for the MATLAB version.

## Instructions
All versions of the program can be simply called and ran from a terminal or command window for that language.

## Example Usage
For the Python version (while inside a terminal window):
```
python3 hello-world.py
```
For the C++ version (while inside a terminal window):
```
g++ hello-world.cpp -o hello-world -std=C++11
./hello-world
```
For the MATLAB version (while inside the MATLAB development environment):
```
run hello-world.m
```
