## General Information
This repository contains the code to print `Hello, World!` to standard output in many languages. All code was created by me, Isaac Joffe, in January of 2022.

## Description
The aim of the project is to create basic "Hello, World!" test programs in as many languages as possible. All the programs output the string literal "Hello, World!" to standard output.

## Background
The "Hello, World!" program is a common test program used to ensure proper functionality of a hardware/software system. It is a common program used to outline the fundamentals of a programming language and has been around since the 1970s. More information can be found at the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program.

## Technologies
The code contained is written across many languages, currently including Python 3.8.10, C++ 11, and MATLAB r2020a. I created all the code using my personal virtual machine, which runs the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system, through the Sublime Text text editor and the Linux terminal window for the Python and C++ versions, and using the MATLAB software package for the MATLAB version.

## Instructions
All versions of the program can be simply called and ran from a terminal/command window for that language.

## Example Usage
For the Python version:
```
python3 hello-world.py
```
For the C++ version:
```
g++ hello-world.cpp -o hello-world -std=C++11
./hello-world
```
For the MATLAB version:
```
run hello-world.m
```
